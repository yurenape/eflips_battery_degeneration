<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Here, you should list what software is required to run the project. For example, you might need to install OpenLCA (which version?), whether it runs on Windows, Mac, or Linux or whether a specific Python version is required.

Basically, if it is something you cannot install with a simple `pip install`, you should list it here.

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install pip packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

<!-- DOCUMENTATION -->

## Documentation

This project is documented using the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation generator. The documentation is in the `docs` directory. Sphix-Autoapi is used to automatically generate documentation from the source code's docstrings. To build the documentation, run the following command:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
cd docs
sphinx-build -b html . _build
```

The documentation will be built in the `_build` directory. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the documentation.
